## Pros & Cons of Test-Driven Development
**Pros:** TDD is beneficial because it ensures the testing process is automated so that the developers can get a higher degree of confidence in functionality and performance at the time of deployment. It also encourages constant testing of features instead of pushing off testing until the last minute. Since each feature is associated with a test case, TDD allows for more granularity and more modular design that makes it easier to debug, maintain and refactor. Lastly, TDD fits well with the Agile Methodology. <br><br>
**Cons:** A minor downside of TDD is the need to constantly update and maintain the tests when feature functionality or requirements change throughout the development cycle. Another pitfall is its impact on the development speed when starting a project since time has to be spent on designing the tests such that it's not trivial but not too large or complex. TDD also has limited testing, since the test cases are written on the expected behaviour of the code, there could be edge cases or scenarios not accounted for. Lastly, TDD is only beneficial if the team is committed to the practice together.
